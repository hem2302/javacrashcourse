	//For Interface, 100% abstraction is achieved

	//What is Abstraction
	//Abstraction is hiding the implementation details of the class and showing only the functionality of the class.
	//If a method is declared as an abstract or doesn't have any implementation, then it will be considered as the Abstract class.#
	//If a method doesn't have the implementation, then the method should be declared with ABSTRACT keyword.
	//If any one of the method is declared as an Abstract, then the class also should be declared as abstract.
	//For the abstract class, Object CANNOT BE CREATED.
	//An abstract can have both abstract methods and fully implemented methods.
	//Abstract class can have the constructor
	
	//If a child class inherits the parent abstract class methods, then all the abstract methods should be implemented
	//or else child class also should be declared as Abstract.
	//If the child class is declared as the abstract, then OBJECT CANNOT BE CREATE FOR child class as well
